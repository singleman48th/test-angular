  You can test SQL statements by choosing Create New from the SQL menu. 
  You can execute select statements and other DML statements (Insert, Update, 
  Delete) in this window. DDL statements can also be executed with the syntax

[PORTABLE MODE]
  By creating a "Portable" folder in the same folder as A5M2.exe in advance, it 
  is possible to operate in "portable mode" where all settings and temporary 
  files / SQL log files are placed in the "Portable" folder I can do it.

  With this, you can place A5:SQL Mk-2 on a USB memory etc, and you can share 
  settings on each PC.

  Portable mode has the following features.

  · Do not write to the registry
  · Do not create temporary files other than "Portable" folder
  · All settings, temporary files, and SQL log files are encrypted with AES (256 bit)
  · Start password can be set

  In the portable mode, as described above, all settings, temporary files, and 
  SQL log files are encrypted with AES (key length: 256 bits). Therefore, if 
  you set up the startup password, even if you lose the USB memory with 
  A5:SQL Mk-2 in the unlikely event, you can set the DB setting information, 
  temporarily saved SQL · ER diagram · script, It is possible to minimize the 
  possibility of logged log files being leaked.

  Of course, you can also use the portable mode for not writing to the registry 
  without entering into the USB memory etc.

  Microsoft Store Edition is not available in portable mode.
